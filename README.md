# monitoring

This Repository contains some usefull monitoring stuff.
The scripts can be executed with check_mk as local Checks or plugins.

Just copy the scripts to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/../ on your monitored client.

For plugins you need to copy the plugin-evaluation script to your monitoring server to /opt/omd/site/../local/share/check_mk/checks/ to handle the output of your client.
