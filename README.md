This Repository contains some usefull monitoring stuff.
The scripts can be executed with check_mk as local Checks or plugins.

You could copy the scripts to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/../ on your monitored client.

For plugins you should copy the plugin-evaluation scipt to /opt/omd/site/../local/share/check_mk/checks/ to handle the output of your client.
